## Description

A CLI tool written in Go to interface with a [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless) instance.

## Installation and usage

### Prerequisites

You should have a working Go environment and have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`.

### Precompiled binary

You can get a precompiled binary from the releases page (soon).

### Self-compiled binary

To download source, compile, and install, run:
```shell
$ go get -u github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli
$ $GOPATH/src/github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli/build.sh
```

The source code will be located in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli`.

A newly compiled binary will be in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli/bin/`

You can place the binary in you `$PATH` for easy usage. e.g.

`$ cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli/bin/paperless-cli $GOPATH/bin`

`$ which paperless-cli` should return the path to the newly installed binary.

### Usage

#### Check paperless-cli version

```shell
$ paperless-cli version
paperless-cli v0.6.0 built on 2019-03-10T16:28:33Z from git:c8dd2e7-clean (master) by user@chrx
```

#### Setting up a config

You can set up a basic YAML-based configuration to be read by placing it in
`$HOME/.paperless-cli.yaml`.

A base config can be autogenerated with `paperless-cli config create`.

Here's an example configuration:
```yaml
# A basic paperless-cli configuration file.

# The hostname of the Paperless instance.
hostname: localhost
# Connect via HTTP or HTTPS.
use_https: false
# Port the Paperless instance is listening on.
port: 8000
# Path to the API root.
root: /api
# Username to auth to Paperless instance.
username: myUsername
# Username to auth to Paperless instance.
password: mYpa$$w0rd.is.h0p3fully.s3cur3!!1
```
## Development

### Prerequisites

You should have a working Go environment and have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`.

### Get the code

To download the source code, run:
```shell
$ go get -du github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli
```

The source code will be located in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli`.

### Running the tests

`$ go test`

Really though, there are none and need to be written.
